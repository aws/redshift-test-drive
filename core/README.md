# Simple Replay README

## Introduction

Customers are always trying to reproduce issues or workloads from clusters or to do what-if scenarios. A customer can easily clone a production cluster, but replicating the workload is more complicated. Simple Replay was created to bridge that gap. Simple Replay V2 enhances existing Simple Replay tool by providing following additional functionalities: 

* Ability to mimic COPY and UNLOAD workloads. 
* Ability to execute the transactions and queries in the same time interval as executed in the source cluster. 

This enables the replay to be as close to the source run. It is **strongly recommended** to run Simple Replay from a cloud EC2 instance.  

If you want to experiment with different Amazon Redshift cluster configurations to evaluate and compare how your workload performs you can use Amazon Redshift Node Configuration Comparison utility (https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-redshift-config-compare) which invokes Simple Replay utility. It provides ability to configure the necessary resources and will automatically execute the workload across N number of clusters.
For more details about this utility please check https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/compare-different-node-types-for-your-workload-using-amazon-redshift/

**NOTE:** Simple Replay now supports both Redshift Provisioned and Serverless. But Amazon Redshift Node Configuration Comparison utility currently supports only Redshift Provisioned clusters; support for Serverless is coming soon.

## Preparation

### Step 1 - Amazon Redshift production cluster setup

The first step is to enable audit logging in the Redshift production cluster. We’ll need all 3 types of logs: connection logs, user logs and user activity logs.

1. Using AWS Console, enable audit logging in the cluster specifying an S3 bucket location to save the log files  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/db-auditing.html
2. Change the parameter group `enable_user_activity_logging` to “true”.
3. Reboot the cluster
4. Take a snapshot of the source cluster prior to execution of the workload to be captured. This snapshot will be used to restore the target cluster, ensuring the target cluster is in the same state as the source cluster.

It may take around three hours for the audit logs to be delivered to S3.

### Step 2 - Simple Replay setup

1. Create an EC2 instance
    1. Recommended EC2 instance type: **m5.8xlarge**, 32GB of SSD storage, Amazon Linux AMI
    2. The cluster must be accessible from where Simple Replay is being run. This may entail modifying the security group inbound rules or running Simple Replay on the same VPC as the Redshift replica cluster. 
2. Install Simple Replay and libraries dependencies on the provided EC2 machine

In the newly created EC2 machine:

2.1 Install Python3.
Check if Python is already installed by doing ``which python3``. If the python3 binary is not found, then use:

```
sudo yum install python3

sudo yum install python3-pip
```

2.2 Install ODBC dependencies

```
sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ python3 python3-devel unixODBC unixODBC-devel
```

2.3 Clone Simple Replay scripts. Check if `git` is installed by doing ``which git``. If git binary cannot be found, then do ``yum install git`` before proceeding.

```
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-redshift-utils.git
```

2.4 Install Python libraries

In Simple Replay root directory, you will find the file requirements.txt. Run the following command

```
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2.5 Install ODBC Driver for Linux

Follow the steps provided by the documentation and install ODBC Driver for Linux
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/configure-odbc-connection.html

2.6 AWS CLI

Check if AWS CLI is configured in the machine. If it’s not configured, follow the steps in [installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)

2.7 Configure AWS CLI

```
aws configure
```
            * Provided IAM user should have Redshift and S3 permissions. If temporary IAM credentials are being used, ensure they do not expire before the replay ends.
            * The IAM user needs to have permission to read the Audit logs S3 bucket configured in Step 1. This is required for the Extraction step of Simple Replay.
            * The IAM user needs to have Redshift::GetClusterCredentials and redshift:DescribeLoggingStatus This is required for the Replay step of Simple Replay

### Step 3 - COPY and UNLOAD setup

The following steps are important to mimic any COPY and UNLOAD command 

1. S3 bucket for UNLOAD commands

Create a temporary S3 bucket where UNLOAD will spill data to S3.

1. IAM role for S3 COPY and UNLOAD commands

Create an IAM role with read access to S3 buckets where COPY will read from. Add write access to the temporary S3 bucket created in the previous step. Make sure the IAM role has a trust relationship with Redshift. This role will be attached to the replica cluster before running Simple Replay.

More information on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/copy-unload-iam-role.html

## Running Extraction

This script extracts query and connection info from User Activity Log (audit) and Connection Log (audit).

* Extraction process supports both Redshift Provisioned cluster and Serverless endpoint
* If the source cluster end point is provided as input in the YAML file, Simple Replay will automatically determine the location to extract the audit logs from, either it is S3 or Cloudwatch. Cloudwatch Audit Logs are now supported for both Provisioned Cluster and Serverless  
* Customer can provide the s3 bucket or local directory in YAML file as log location if they choose not to provide the source cluster endpoint
* Simple Replay will extract starttime and endtime for each query from the system table automatically if the source cluster end point is provided as input in the YAML file. Recordtime from audit logs will be used otherwise. 
* The source cluster should be accessible from wherever Simple Replay is being run. This may entail modifying the security group inbound rules to include “My IP”, or running Simple Replay on an EC2 instance in the same VPC.

### Command

Once the above configuration parameters are set in extraction.yaml, the workload from the source cluster can be extracted using the following command:

```
python3 extract.py extract/extract.yaml
```

### Output

Simple Replay extract process produces the following outputs in the 

* sqls.json.gz
    * Contains the extracted SQL scripts.
* connections.json
    * Contains the extracted connections
* copy_replacements.csv
    * Contains the COPY locations found in the extracted workload. A replacement location may be specified to provide an alternate COPY location for replay. IAM role is mandatory to replay COPY workload.

## Running Replay

Takes an extracted workload and replays it against a target cluster. Target cluster could be a Redshift Provisioned or Serverless cluster.

### Preparation

#### Replay on Provisioned 

* Restore the target cluster from the source cluster snapshot.
* The cluster must be accessible from wherever Simple Replay is being run.
    This may entail modifying the security group inbound rules to include “My IP”, or running Simple Replay on an EC2 instance in the same VPC.
* To execute COPY commands, the `execute_copy_statements` parameter must be set to `"true"`, and the “Replacement IAM role” column in the copy_replacements.csv file must have an IAM role for each row.
* Any UNLOAD/COPY command within stored procedures must be altered manually or removed to skip execution.

#### Replay on Serverless

* Restore the Serverless target cluster from the source cluster snapshot.
* Simple Replay provides 2 different options to connect to target Redshift Serverless Cluster:
  * Target Cluster Endpoint: 
    * Cluster must be accessible from the system on which you're running Simple Replay from 
    * This may entail modifying the security group inbound rules to include “My IP”, or running Simple Replay on an EC2 instance in the same VPC.
    * Specify the value in ```target_cluster_endpoint```
  * NLB / NAT: 
    * This option provides ability to run the Simple Replay from outside of your Cluster's VPC.
    * Provide NLB / NAT endpoint that has access to the Redshift Cluster.
    * Specify the value in ```nlb_nat_dns```
    * Value still must be provided for ```target_cluster_endpoint```
* One can optionally setup Secrets Manager which maps all individual users from extract to a single admin user. See "Setting up Secrets Manager" section for detailed steps.

### Replay for generating Analysis Report 

Replay also supports generation of pdf reports which enhances auditing in the Simple Replay process to extract information about the errors that occurred, the validity of the run, and the performance of the replay.




#### Authorizing Access to Redshift using AWS Secrets Manager 
Follow below steps to setup the integration between Simple Replay and AWS Secrets Manager. It can also be used to execute workloads which rely on Redshift's native IDP integration with non-IAM identity providers ( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/redshift-iam-access-control-native-idp.html )

Note: Setting up secrets manager is not required, but an optional step

* Configure admin username and password using AWS Secrets Manager - https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/home
* Select "Other type of secret"
* Setup 1 secret with 2 Keys exactly as named below and provide their values:
  * admin_username
  * admin_password
* Provide value of this Secrets Manager in ```secret_name``` in ```replay.yaml``` 
* Confirm that the Role attached to EC2 from where Simple Replay is being executed has GetSecretValue policy attached to it. It is needed for Secrets Manager. Attaching just this policy is a guideline that follows security advice of granting least required privilege

### Command

```
python3 replay.py replay.yaml
```

### Output

* Any errors from replay will be saved to workload_location provided in the `replay.yaml`
* Any output from UNLOADs will be saved to the replay_output provided in the `replay.yaml`
* Any system tables logs will be saved to the replay_output provided in the `replay.yaml`
* The analysis report will be saved to the analysis_output under analysis folder on s3
The analysis folder structure is as follows :
   * out
      - info.json: Cluster id, run start time, run end time, instance type, node count
     - replayid_report.pdf  
  * raw_data
    - raw csv files containing UNLOADed data
  * aggregated_data
    - formatted csv files as the data appears in the report

## Limitations 

* Dependent SQL queries across connections are not guaranteed to run in the original order.
* Spectrum queries are not replayed if the target cluster doesn’t have access to external tables
* COPY and UNLOAD command within stored procedures must be altered manually by the customers. 
* Replay using JDBC is not supported.
* If a connection’s session initiation or disconnection time are not found in the audit connection logs (e.g. outside of the specified `start_time` and `end_time`), the connection’s time is assumed to be the overall workload’s time.
* If a connection is not found in the audit connection log, but has queries associated with it in the user activity logs, the connection's `session_initiation_time` and `disconnection_time` are set to the overall workload's times. The connection will span the entire workload.
* There are cases where audit log capture internal Redshift re-writes of the queries. These queries might be replayed multiple times on the target as the duplicate entries in the logs are captured by the extract. 
* Limitations specific to Serverless:
  * Compilation time metric is not available for Serverless. So elapsed and execution times will include compilation time as well.
  * Commit time metric is not available for Serverless.
  * Replay analysis currently only supports CSV format. PDF report generation is work in progress.
